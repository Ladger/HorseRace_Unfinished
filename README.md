# HorseRace_Unfinished
My turtle and sqlite based horse racing program

In this program, i tried to learn sqlite and turtle libraries in python.

Turtle Program:
It is basically graphic addition to race, I wanted my program looks good so I added.

Sqlite Program:
In this program, I added six horses to database which includes stats like Name, Age, Reputation, Condition, Wins, Loses, Odd, Effect
If I need to explain what are these stats:
Name -> Horse's name
Age -> effects its speed
Reputation -> effects its odds (higher rep lower odd)
Condition -> effects its speed
Wins and Loses -> effects odds
Odd -> the value of horse's win chance (lower odd means higher win chance)
Effect -> the mix of age and condition

Main Program:
It is main program which choosing the operation about the program.

#THE PROJECT IS UNFINISHED, I NEED TO ADD EDITING TO STATS IN MAIN PROGRAM BUT I ALREADY DID FUNCTIONS WHICH CAN EDIT STATS.
